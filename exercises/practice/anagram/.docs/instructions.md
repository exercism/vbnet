# Instructions

An anagram is a rearrangement of letters to form a new word (or phrase consisting of 
multiple words). Given a word and a list of candidates, select the sublist of anagrams 
of the given word.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists", "google",
"inlets", "line", "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`. 

`"line"` is not considered an anagram as it does not use all letters of `"listen"`.

White-space is to be ignored. `"Heroes Cell Mix"` is a valid anagram of `"Hello Exercism"`.

Detail information about the according method contracts that should be implemented 
can be found in the documentation tags.
